# Fetcher Utility Documentation

The `fetcher` utility is a JavaScript function designed to simplify data fetching from an API. It uses the `fetch` API to make HTTP requests and handle the response. This utility is typically used in a vue.js project to fetch data from the specified API endpoint.

## Usage

### Installation

No specific installation is required for the `fetcher` utility. You can include it directly in your vue.js project or any JavaScript/TypeScript file where you need to make API requests.

### Example Usage

```javascript
import { fetcher } from "@/path-to-utils/fetcher";

// Example usage in a vue.js mounted method
async mounted({ params }) {
  const data = await fetcher(`/some-api-endpoint/${params.id}`);
}
```

## API

### `fetcher(route: string): Promise<any>`

- **Parameters:**
  - `route` (string): The API endpoint or route to fetch data from.

- **Returns:**
  - A `Promise` that resolves to the parsed JSON response if the HTTP request is successful.

- **Usage:**
  - Call this function with the desired API route to fetch data.

### Example

```javascript
const baseUrl = "https://api.nuxtjs.dev";

export const fetcher = async (route: string) => {
  const request = `${baseUrl}${route}`;
  const response = await fetch(request);

  if (response.ok) {
    return await response.json();
  }
};
```

- **Base URL:** The base URL for the API (`https://api.nuxtjs.dev` in this example).
- **Request URL:** Combines the base URL with the specified route.
- **Fetch:** Uses the `fetch` API to make an HTTP request.
- **Response Handling:** Checks if the response is successful (status code 200-299) and parses the JSON response if so.

## Considerations

- Ensure that the `fetch` API is available in your runtime environment (commonly available in browsers and Node.js environments).

- Adjust the `baseUrl` according to your API server.

- This utility is a basic example and may need modifications based on the specific requirements and error-handling strategies of your project.
