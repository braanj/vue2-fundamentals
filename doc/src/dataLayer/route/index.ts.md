# Handler Utility Documentation

The `handler` utility is a JavaScript function designed to act as an intermediary for making API requests using the `fetcher` utility. It encapsulates the fetching logic and provides a clean interface for making requests to specific API routes. This utility is typically used in a vue.js project or any JavaScript/TypeScript file where you want a centralized place to handle API requests.

## Usage

### Installation

Ensure that the `fetcher` utility is available in your project before using the `handler` utility. You can include both utilities directly in your vue.js project or any JavaScript/TypeScript file where you need to make API requests.

### Example Usage

```javascript
import { handler } from "@/path-to-utils/handler";

// Example usage in a vue.js mounted method
async mounted({ params }) {
  const data = await handler(`/some-api-endpoint/${params.id}`);
}
```

## API

### `handler(route: string): Promise<any>`

- **Parameters:**
  - `route` (string): The API endpoint or route to fetch data from.

- **Returns:**
  - A `Promise` that resolves to the parsed JSON response if the HTTP request is successful.

- **Usage:**
  - Call this function with the desired API route to fetch data.

### Example

```javascript
import { fetcher } from "..";

export const handler = async (route: string) => {
  return await fetcher(route);
};
```

- **Import Statement:** Imports the `fetcher` utility.
- **Function Definition:** Defines a `handler` function that takes an API route as a parameter.
- **Usage of `fetcher`:** Calls the `fetcher` utility with the provided route to handle the API request.

## Considerations

- Ensure that the `fetcher` utility is available in your project.

- This `handler` utility serves as a simple example and may need modifications based on the specific requirements and error-handling strategies of your project.

- You can extend this utility to include additional functionality, such as logging, error handling, or custom headers, based on your project's needs.
